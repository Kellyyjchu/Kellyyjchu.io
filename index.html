  <h1>Mythic Art & Mental Health</h1>
  <div class="title">

<div class="overview"><p>Nikita Gill’s sixth volume of poetry “changes” the “lens” through which readers experience ancient myths.
  Gill uses this reframing technique to apply contemporary themes to such timeless stories and figures such as Medusa, Ares, and Persephone.
  <br>
  While reexamining these stories and characters, Gill explores mental health, relationship dynamics, 
  trauma, gender, identity, and sexuality.</p>
</div>

<h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
<div class="purpose"><p>
The purpose of this exhibition is to invite students to contribute their own creative artworks to a campus wide collaborative exhibition.
    Inspired by the Gill's poetry, the exhibition would ask that works examine
    mental health using by reframing ancient mythological stories. 
<br>
<br>
Through the use of art and myths, the exhibition creator hopes that the student works will
encourage campus conversations about mental health.

<h3>UNC System & Mental Health</h3>

<div class ="uncsystem">
  <p> Students across the UNC system have reported struggling with mental health.
    <a href="https://www.wunc.org/news/2023-03-21/unc-system-president-outlines-mental-health-programs-to-address-student-need">One survey </a> 
    saw 47% of students report experiencing “severe symptoms of depression/anxiety." 
<br>
<br>
  To address community concerns on student mental wellness, the UNC System has stated 
  that “the System is working to equip students with the skills 
  required to understand and navigate their own mental health 
  challenges, while also reducing the stigma around critical 
  mental health conversations and empowering faculty, 
  administration, staff, and peers to identify the early warning 
  signs of a mental health crisis.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This art exhibition is a student led contribution to the continual conversation
  of mental wellness in and around UNC's campus.

<h4>Mental Health  & Art</h4>

<div class ="healthart">
<p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9472646/">Studies</a> have shown that 
“participating in creative activities can help people cope 
with stress and despair and alleviate the burden of chronic mental illnesses.”
Further, they have also shown that participants in art therapy demonstrated an improvement in
  “overall wellness or everyday anxiety”
when interacting with the creative process and works. 
<br>
<br>
By engaging in the creative process, student contributors are reaping some of the 
benefits of art therapy. Students and staff who interact with the exhibit 
will also recieve an improvement in overall wellness. These benefits add to those gained by 
furthering conversations focused on wellbeing.

<h5>Mental Health & Myths</h5>

<div class="healthmyths">
<p>
  The exhibition's use of mythology also has potential wellness benefits.  
  <a href="https://doi-org.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/10.1080/13674670903196721">
    Studies</a> have demonstrated that fairy tales, legends, and myths can be used to elicit 
  “positive benefits for emotional well-being.”
<br>
<br>
Additionaly, “as part of the healing process literature is often underrated”
“Such stories enable people to “access …crucial issues and confront them in a symbolic form” notes Steven Walker,
clinical social worker who specialized in childhood therapy in the UK.
<br>
<br>
Engaging with myths and recentering these old stories can allow students to
explore areas of mental health that may be initially too uncomfortable to 
engage with headon.
